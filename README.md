# O'Neillo Game
This game was created for my Programming Fundamentals course. The idea is to show that i have gained knowledge and understood the concepts presented throughout the course.
The game othello is a 2 player game where each player takes a turn to place a coloured tile and flip an opposition tile. The winner is decided by who has the most coloured tiles when there are no possible moves left for either player.
This game contains a save and restore game function so that gamestates can be retained.
